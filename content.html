                    <h3>HTML</h3>
                    <p>
                      HTML is at the core of every web page, regardless the complexity
                      of a site or number of technologies involved. It's an essential
                      skill for any web professional. It's the starting point for anyone
                      learning how to create content for the web. And, luckily for us,
                      it's surprisingly easy to learn. HTML stands for HyperText Markup
                      Language. "Markup language" means that, rather than using a
                      programming language to perform functions, HTML uses tags to
                      identify different types of content and the purposes they each
                      serve to the webpage.
                      <br>
                      HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content.

                    <h3>CSS</h3>
                    <p>
                      CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. This programming language
                      dictates how the HTML elements of a website should actually appear
                      on the frontend of the page. HTML provides the raw tools needed to
                      structure content on a website. CSS, on the other hand, helps to
                      style this content so it appears to the user the way it was
                      intended to be seen. These languages are kept separate to ensure
                      websites are built correctly before they're reformatted.Whereas HTML was the basic structure of your website, CSS is what gives your entire website its style. Those slick colors, interesting fonts, and background images? All thanks to CSS. This language affects the entire mood and tone of a web page, making it an incredibly powerful tool -- and an important skill for web developers to learn. It's also what allows websites to adapt to different screen sizes and device types.

                      <h3>JavaScript</h3>
                      <p>JavaScript is a more complicated language than HTML or CSS, and it wasn't released in beta form until 1995. Nowadays, JavaScript is supported by all modern web browsers and is used on almost every site on the web for more powerful and complex functionality. JavaScript is a logic-based programming language that can be used to modify website content and make it behave in different ways in response to a user's actions. Common uses for JavaScript include confirmation boxes, calls-to-action, and adding new identities to existing information.In short, JavaScript is a programming language that lets web developers design interactive sites. Most of the dynamic behavior you'll see on a web page is thanks to JavaScript, which augments a browser's default controls and behaviors.
